                        <h2>Types of cookies and how we use them</h2>
                        <h3>Essential cookies</h3>
                        <p>Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins and account management. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our website.</p>
                        <h3>Performance cookies</h3>
                        <p>Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without collecting personal information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across all site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their audience’s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance cookies on our site.</p>
                    <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
                    <p>Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings
                            you may configure on the website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With
                            this information, websites can provide you with customised, enhanced or optimised content
                            and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
                            third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.</p>
                            <h4>Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
                            <p>Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more
                            relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver
                            targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This helps
                            companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented
                            to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
                            third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to
                            track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. We do not use this type
                            of cookie on our site.</p>
                            <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
                            <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites—for example, analytics
                            providers and content partners. We grant these third parties access to selected information
                            to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in order to
                            deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track you on
                            other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no control over third-party
                            cookies, they are not covered by Cronhub's cookie policy.</p>
<h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
<p>We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before enlisting their
                            services to ensure their practices align with ours. We will never knowingly include
                            third-party services that compromise or violate the privacy of our users.</p>
                            <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
                            <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies
                            from our website. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can
                            update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website
                            is trying to set or update a cookie.</p>
                            <p>If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each
                            individual device.</p>
                            <p>Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website,
                            blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to access certain features and content across
                            the sites you visit.</p>
